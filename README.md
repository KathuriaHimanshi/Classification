# Classification

Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you useclassification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.

`In this Repo, we will implement the following Machine Learning Classification models:`

#### 1.  Logistic Regression

#### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)

#### 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

#### 4. Kernel SVM

#### 5. Naive Bayes

#### 6. Decision Tree Classification

#### 7. Random Forest Classification

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 


### Data

`Social_Network_Ads.csv contains data of 401 users of a social networking site`


### Task
