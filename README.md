# Classification

Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you useclassification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.

In this Repo, we will implement the following Machine Learning Classification models:

1.Logistic Regression

2.K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)

3.Support Vector Machine (SVM)

4.Kernel SVM

5.Naive Bayes

6.Decision Tree Classification

7.Random Forest Classification


Install

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy

Pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
