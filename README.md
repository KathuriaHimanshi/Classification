# Classification

Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you useclassification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.

`In this Repo, we will implement the following Machine Learning Classification models:`

#### 1.  [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/KathuriaHimanshi/Classification/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)

#### 2. [K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)](https://github.com/KathuriaHimanshi/Classification/blob/master/K-NN.ipynb)

#### 3. [Support Vector Machine (SVM)](https://github.com/KathuriaHimanshi/Classification/blob/master/svm.ipynb)

#### 4. [Kernel SVM](https://github.com/KathuriaHimanshi/Classification/blob/master/kernel_svm.ipynb)

#### 5. [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/KathuriaHimanshi/Classification/blob/master/naive_bayes.ipynb)

#### 6. [Decision Tree Classification](https://github.com/KathuriaHimanshi/Classification/blob/master/decision_%20tree_Class.ipynb)

#### 7. [Random Forest Classification](https://github.com/KathuriaHimanshi/Classification/blob/master/Random%20Forest.ipynb)

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 


### Data

`Social_Network_Ads.csv contains data of 401 users of a social networking site`


### Task

`Create a model to determine whether a specific user of the site will buy the product advertised or not`
